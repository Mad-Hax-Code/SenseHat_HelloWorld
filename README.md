# Learn Python 3 with Raspberry Pi & SenseHat: Part 1
## SenseHat Educational Series
Welcome and congratulations on deciding to learn Python!

The intent of this repository series is to teach Python in a way that is fun, exciting, and efficient. The SenseHat for the Raspberry Pi provides an excellent platform to teach and explore programming while being useful and entertaining from the very beginning! My hope is that coders of all ages and experience levels will be able to benefit from this material.

The content starts off at the beginning level typical of most tutorials with a Hello World application. There are multiple versions of the example application for each repository that demonstrate additional programming concepts. It is important to start at the first version, type all of the code yourself, and see the results before moving to the next version. Part of the goal is to provide some repetition of typing the language which will greatly reduce the time it takes to learn Python - or any programming language for that matter.

## Your First Program!
To follow with the tradition of the countless coders that have come before you, we will start a Hello World application. There are currently 3 versions of the application in this repository. Start with the first one before moving on to the next and type all of the code yourself to improve knowledge retention!

The order of the code examples is indicated by the number following the name of the script:
* HelloWorld_1.py
* HelloWorld_2.py
* HelloWorld_3.py

## What's Next?
Done with these examples? Make sure you take time to do your own experimentation with your newfound knowledge. The next lesson is:
